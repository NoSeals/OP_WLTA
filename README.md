# Governance On The Rise

My contribution to the [We Love the Art](https://welovetheart.optimism.io/) contest in the category generative art. An on-chain art contest with 1,200,000 OP in prizes. Extended submission deadline Jan 8th at 23:00 UTC.

## Description:

Embark on a visual journey through the evolution of Optimism Superchain's governance with this submission to the We Love the Art contest. Witness the rise and significance of the OP token in the Top 100 protocols of the crypto universe, beautifully depicted through a data-driven artistic creation.

## About the Idea:

Observing the fantastic submissions of other artists, many of whom work with random (animated) generative art, inspired me. While I may not excel in that particular style, my proficiency lies in handling statistical software - R in my case. I was determined to process data from L2 or L3 protocols of the Superchain. Contemplating elegant representations of transactions, different chains, and more, I began sketching out initial programming and ideas. Though intriguing, it wasn't the masterpiece I envisioned.

Eventually, a tweet by kain.eth regarding the behavior of various tokens in the Top 100 over the years and their changes sparked a crucial idea – a representation of the OP token in the crypto world. Governance forms the backbone of the Superchain and is arguably its most crucial element post-development. I wanted to visually depict its importance, presence, and ascent in the crypto universe, from the first recording of top crypto protocols to the end of 2023.

The resulting graphic aims to blend art and data, employing simple colors, shades of gray, with occasional color highlights, some sort of streetart-style. It's my attempt to create graphics that captivate both aesthetically and informatively.

## Implementation:

The graphic was programmed in the statistical software R, utilizing historical data of the Top 100 protocols every Sunday from April 28, 2013, to December 31, 2023. It weekly displays the Top 100, where color intensity signifies the duration in the Top 100 – the stronger the color (gray or red), the longer the protocol remains in the Top 100. For clarity, the color is most intense when a protocol has been in the Top 100 for a year, equivalent to 52 weeks.

The accompanying code is available on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NoSeals/OP_WLTA/).

In addition to all other protocols displayed on the gradient from light gray to dark gray, the OP token is highlighted in it´s typical red. On August 7, 2022, the token first entered the Top 100, briefly disappeared, only to resurface in the third week of 2023 and consistently ascend. By the end of the year, the OP token unexpectedly ranked in the Top 30, underscoring its importance and presence in the crypto universe. Very excited what to come next.

## About Me:

In my real life, I am a biostatistician with a deep passion for data visualization. Thus, it was only natural to combine my skills with the art of graphical representation. I love generative art, and I consider data visualization, especially artistically crafted data visualization, to be a powerful means of not only creating art but also conveying complex information in a beautiful and simple way. With my artistic portrayal of data, I aim to unite aesthetics and information.

## Some last words:

This submission aims not only to contribute to non-data-driven art but also to showcase that data can be a form of art. It emphasizes the importance of data in understanding and navigating our ever-evolving world.

Data is beautiful and speaks for itself; data makes the art. ❤️
